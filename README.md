# Plato Chat (WIP)

## Getting Started

```bash
bun install
bun run start
```

To make things work on your local simulator, or on your phone, you need first to [run `eas build`](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/expo/EAS.md). We have many shortcuts on `package.json` to make it easier:

```bash
bun run build:ios:sim # build for ios simulator
bun run build:ios:dev # build for ios device
bun run build:ios:prod # build for ios device
```

### `./assets` directory

The assets directory are further categorized into subdirectories, including `icons` and `images`:

```tree
assets
├── icons
└── images
```

**icons**
This is where the icon assets live. These icons can be used for buttons, navigation elements, or any other UI components. The recommended format for icons is PNG, but other formats can be used as well.

Ignite (the boilerplate used for this app) comes with a built-in `Icon` component. You can find detailed usage instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/boilerplate/app/components/Icon.md).

**images**
This is where images live, such as background images, logos, or any other graphics. Various other formats can be used such as PNG, JPEG, or GIF for your images.

Another valuable built-in component within Ignite is the `AutoImage` component. You can find detailed usage instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/Components-AutoImage.md).

How to use the `icon` or `image` assets:

```typescript
import { Image } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Image source={require('assets/images/my_image.png')} />
  );
};
```
